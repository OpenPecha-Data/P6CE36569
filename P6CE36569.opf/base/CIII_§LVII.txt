[CHAPTER FIVE]

LXXXI (217) At that time again, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this to the Blessed
One:Is the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Fully-Enlightened One, permanent or
impermanent?Said the Blessed One: Mahāmati, the Tathāgata is neither permanent nor impermanent.Why?
Because either way there is a fault connected with it.Mahāmati, what fault is connected
with either assertion?1If the Tathāgata is permanent, he will be connected with the
creating agencies.For, Mahāmati, according to all the philosophers the creating agencies
are something uncreated and permanent.But the Tathāgata is not permanent [in the same sense]
as the uncreated are permanent.If he is impermanent, he will be connected with things
created.Because the Skandhas which are predicable as qualified and qualifying are nonexistent,
and because the Skandhas are subject to annihilation, destructibility is their nature.Mahāmati,
all that is created is impermanent as is a jug, a garment, straw, a piece of wood,
a brick, etc., which are all connected with impermanency.Thus all the preparations for
the knowledge of the All-Knowing One will become useless as they are things created.On account
of no distinction being made, the Tathāgata, indeed, would be something created.For
this reason, the Tathāgata is neither permanent nor impermanent.

Again, Mahāmati, the Tathāgata is not permanentfor the reason that [if he were] he would be
like space, and the preparations one makes for Tathāgatahood would be useless.That is to say,
Mahāmati, space is neither permanent nor impermanent as it excludes [the idea of] permanence
and impermanence, (218) and it is improper to speak of it as characterised with the
faults of oneness and otherness, of bothness and not-bothness, of permanence and impermanence.

Further, Mahāmati, it is like the horns of a hare, or a horse, or an ass, or a camel, or a frog,
or a snake, or a fly, or a fish; [with the Tathāgata] as with them here is the permanency
of no-birth.Because of this fault of the permanency of no-birth, the Tathāgata cannot
be permanent.

However, Mahāmati, there is another sense in which the Tathāgata can be said to be permanent.How?
Because the knowledge arising from the attainment of enlightenment [ = an intuitive
understanding] is of a permanent nature, the Tathāgata is permanent.Mahāmati, this knowledge,
as it is attained intuitively by the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones, is, indeed,
permanent.Whether the Tathāgatas are born or not, this Dharmatā, which is the regulative
and sustaining principle to be discoverable in the enlightenment of all the Śrāvakas,
Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, abides,and this sustaining principle of existence is
not like the emptiness of space, which, however, is not understood by the ignorant and simple-minded.Mahāmati,
this knowledge of enlightenment belonging to the Tathāgatas comes forth
from transcendental knowledge (prajnajñāna);Mahāmati, the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened
Ones do not come forth from the habit-energy of ignorance which is concerned with
the Citta, Manas, and Manovijñāna, and the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas.The triple world
originates from the discriminating of unrealities, but the Tathāgatas do not originate from
the discriminating of unrealities.Where duality obtains, Mahāmati, there is permanency
and impermanency because of its not being one.Mahāmati, [the truth of] absolute solitude
is, indeed, non-dualistic2 because all things are characterised with non-duality and no-birth.For
this reason, Mahāmati, the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones are neither
permanent nor impermanent.Mahāmati, as long as there is word-discrimination, (219) there follows
the faulty notion of permanency and impermanency.The destruction of the notion of permanency
and impermanency as held by the ignorant, Mahāmati, comes from the getting rid of
the knowledge that is based on discrimination, and not from the getting rid of the knowledge
that is based on the insight of solitude.

So it is said:

1 By keeping away permanency and impermanency, [and yet] by keeping permanency and impermanency
in sight, those who always see the Buddhas will not expose themselves to the power of
the philosophical doctrines.

2 When permanency and impermanency are adhered to all the accumulation [one makes for the attainment
of reality] will be of no avail; by destroying the knowledge that is based on discrimination,
[the idea of] permanency and impermanency is kept back.

3 As soon as an assertion is made, all is in confusion; when it is understood that there is
nothing in the world but what is seen of the Mind itself, disputes never arise.

Here Ends the Fifth Chapter, “On the Deduction of the Permanency and Impermanency of Tathāgatahood.”
