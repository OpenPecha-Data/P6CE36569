This, Mahﾄ［ati, is called the doctrine that examines into the nature of the five Dharmas and
the two Svabhﾄ」as (self-nature), and constitutes the state of self-realisation attained by
noble wisdom, and in this you and other Bodhisattvas are to discipline yourselves.

XXIV Further again, Mahﾄ［ati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahﾄ《attva have a thorough understanding as
to the nature of the twofold egolessness.
