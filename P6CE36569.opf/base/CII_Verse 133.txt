(71) At that moment the Blessed One said this to elucidate the meaning of this verse: Mahāmati,
there are four forms of assertion made concerning things not in existence.

What are the four? (1) The assertion about individual marks that are non-existent; (2) the assertion
about philosophical views which are non-existent [i.e., not true]; (3) the assertion
about a cause which is non-existent; and (4) the assertion about objects that are non-existent.These,
Mahāmati, are the four assertions.Again, Mahāmati, what is meant by the refutation?

It means not examining properly, because of ignorance, any assertions based on errors.This,
Mahāmati, is what characterises assertion and refutation.Further, Mahāmati, what are the characteristics
of the assertion made about individual marks that have no existence?

It concerns the marks of individuality and generality in the Skandhas, Dhātus and Āyatanas,
which do not really exist; but taking them for realities and getting attached to them, a man
may affirm that they are just so and not otherwise.This, Mahāmati, characterises the assertion
of individual marks which are non-existent.1This assertion and discrimination, Mahāmati,
concerning individual marks that are not existent, rises from one's attachment to the
habit-energy which is amassed, since beginningless time, by varieties of erroneous views
issuing from false imagination.

This, Mahāmati, characterises the assertion of individual marks which are non-existent.Again,
Mahāmati, by the assertion of philosophical views which are non-existent [i.e., not true],
is meant that in the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas, [some philosophers] assume the existence
of an ego, a being, a soul, a living being, a nourisher, or a spirit.

This is said, Mahāmati, to be the assertion of some philosophical views which are nonexistent
[i.e., not true].Again, Mahāmati, by the assertion of a cause that is nonexistent is meant
that [some philosophers] assume the causeless birth of a first (72) Vijñāna, which later
comes to have a Māyā-like non-existence; that is to say, the originally unborn Vijñāna begins
to function under the conditions of eye, form, light, and memory.

The functioning goes on for a while and then ceases.This, Mahāmati, is the assertion of a cause
that is non-existent.Again, Mahāmati, the assertion about objects that are not-existent
is an assertion arising from the attachment to such non-working existences as space, cessation,
and Nirvāṇa.

These, Mahāmati, are neither existent nor nonexistent;for all things are devoid of the alternatives
of being and non-being and are to be known, Mahāmati, as the horns of a hare, a horse,
or a camel, or like a hair-net.They are discriminated as realities by the ignorant who
are addicted to assertions and refutations as their intelligence has not penetrated into
the truth that there is nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself. It is otherwise with
the wise.This, Mahāmati, is the characteristic point of the assertion about objects which
are non-existent.For this reason, Mahāmati, one should avoid the views based on assertion
and refutation.XXVI Further, Mahāmati, the Bodhisattvas who are thoroughly acquainted with
the nature of the Citta, Manas, and Manovijñāna, of the five Dharmas, of the [three] Svabhāvas,
and of the twofold Egolessness, will assume various personalities for the sake of
benefitting others,
