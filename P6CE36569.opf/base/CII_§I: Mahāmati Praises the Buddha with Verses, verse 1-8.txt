§I1 (22) At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva who had visited all the Buddha-lands,
together with all the Bodhisattvas, rose from his seat by the power of the Buddhas, drawing
his upper garment over one shoulder, placing his right knee on the ground and with folded
hands, turning in the direction of the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and praised
him with the following verses:

1. As thou reviewest the world with thy transcendental knowledge and compassion, it is to thee
like an ethereal flower, of which one cannot say whether it is born or destroyed, as [the
category of] being and non-being is inapplicable to it.

2. As thou reviewest all things with thy transcendental knowledge and compassion, they are to
thee like visions, they are beyond the reach of intellectual grasp, as [the category of]
being and non-being is inapplicable to them.

3. As thou reviewest the world with thy transcendental knowledge and compassion, it is to thee
always like a dream, of which one cannot say whether it is permanent or destructible, as
[the category of] being and non-being is inapplicable to it.

4. In the Dharmakaya, whose self-nature is like a vision or a dream, what is there to praise?
When no thought arises as to existence or as to not-having-self-nature, then there is praise.

5. Of a thing whose appearance is not visible because of its being beyond the senses and their
objects (23), how can it be praised or blamed, O Muni?

6. With thy transcendental knowledge and compassion which are above form, thou comprehendest
the egolessness of things and persons, and art thyself always clean and free from the hindrances
of passion and knowledge.

7. Thou dost not vanish in Nirvāṇa, nor is Nirvāṇa abiding in thee; for it transcends the duality
of knowing and known and of being and non-being.

8. Those who see the Muni so serene and beyond birth [and death] will be cleansed of attachment,
stainless both in this world and in the other.
