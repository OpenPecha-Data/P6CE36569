§IVAt that moment, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said again to the Blessed One:In how
many ways, Blessed One, does the rise, abiding, and ceasing of the Vijñānas take place?

The Blessed One replied: There are two ways, Mahāmati, in which the rise, abiding, and ceasing
of the Vijñānas take place, and this is not understood by the philosophers.That is to say,
the ceasing takes place as regards continuation and form.In the rise of the Vijñānas,
also, these two are recognisable: the rise as regards continuation and the rise as regards
form.In the abiding, also, these two [are discernible]: the one taking place as regards continuation
and the other as regards form.[Further,] three modes are distinguishable in the
Vijñānas: (1) the Vijñāna as evolving, (2) the Vijñāna as producing effects, and (3) the
Vijñāna as remaining in its original nature.[Further,] Mahāmati, in the Vijñānas, which are
said to be eight, two functions generally are distinguishable, the perceiving and the object-discriminating.As
a mirror reflects forms, Mahāmati, the perceiving Vijñāna perceives
[objects].Mahāmati, between the two, the perceiving Vijñāna and the object-discriminating
Vijñāna, there is no difference; they are mutually conditioning.Then, Mahāmati, the perciving
Vijñāna functions because of transformation's taking place [in the mind] by reason of
a mysterious habit-energy, while, Mahāmati, the object-discriminating Vijñāna (38) functions
because of the mind's discriminating an objective world and because of the habit-energy
accumulated by erroneous reasoning since beginningless time.

Again, Mahāmati, by the cessation of all the sense-Vijñānas is meant the cessation of the Ālayavijñāna's
variously accumulating habit-energy which is generated when unrealities are discriminated.This,
Mahāmati, is known as the cessation of the form-aspect of the Vijñānas.Again,
Mahāmati, the cessation of the continuation-aspect of the Vijñānas takes place in this
wise:that is to say, Mahāmati, when both that which supports [the Vijñānas] and that which
is comprehended [by the Vijñānas] cease to function.By that which supports [the Vijñānas]
is meant the habit-energy [or memory] which has been accumulated by erroneous reasoning
since beginningless time; and by that which is comprehended [by the Vijñānas] is meant
the objective world perceived and discriminated by the Vijñānas, which is, however, no more
than Mind itself.Mahāmati, it is like a lump of clay and the particles of dust making up
its substance, they are neither different nor not-different; again, it is like gold and various
ornaments made of it.If, Mahāmati, the lump of clay is different from its particles
of dust, no lump will ever come out of them.But as it comes out of them it is not different
from the particles of dust.Again, if there is no difference between the two, the lump will
be indistinguishable from its particles.Even so, Mahāmati, if the evolving Vijñāna are
different from the Ālayavijñāna, even in its original form, the Ālaya cannot be their cause.Again,
if they are not different the cessation of the evolving Vijñānas will mean the cessation
of the Ālayavijñāna, but there is no cessation of its original form.Therefore, Mahāmati,
what ceases to function is not the Ālaya in its original self-form, but is the effect-producing
form of the Vijñānas.When this original self-form ceases to exist, then there
will indeed be the cessation of the Ālayavijñāna.(39) If, however, there is the cessation
of the Ālayavijñāna, this doctrine will in no wise differ from the nihilistic doctrine of
the philosophers.This doctrine, Mahāmati, as it is held by the philosophers, is this: When
the grasping of an objective world ceases the continuation of the Vijñānas is stopped;and
when there is no more of this continuation in the Vijñānas, the continuation that has been
going on since beginningless time is also destroyed.Mahāmati, the philosophers maintain
that there is a first cause from which continuation takes place;they do not maintain that
the eye-Vijñāna arises from the interaction of form and light; they assume another cause.What
is this cause, Mahāmati? Their first cause is known as spirit (pradhāna), soul (puruṣa),
lord (īśvara), time, or atom.
