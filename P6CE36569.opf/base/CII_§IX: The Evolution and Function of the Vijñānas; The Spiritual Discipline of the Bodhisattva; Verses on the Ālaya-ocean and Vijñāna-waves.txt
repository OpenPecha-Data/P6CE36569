IX Then Mahāmati said: Teach me, Blessed One, concerning that most subtle doctrine which explains
the Citta, Manas, Manovijñāna, the five Dharmas, the Svabhāvas, and the lakṣanas; which
is put in practice by the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; which is separated from the state
of mind which recognises a world as something outside Mind itself; and which, breaking down
all the so-called truths established by words and reasonings, constitutes the essence of
the teachings of all the Buddhas.Pray teach this assembly headed by the Bodhisattvas gathering
on Mount Malaya in the city of Laṅkā; teach them regarding the Dharmakaya which is praised
by the Tathāgatas and which is the realm of (44) the Ālayavijñāna which resembles the
ocean with its waves.

Then the Blessed One again speaking to Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this: The reasons
whereby the eye-consciousness arises are four.What are they? They are: (1) The clinging
to an external world, not knowing that it is of Mind itself; (2) The attaching to form
and habit-energy accumulated since beginningless time by false reasoning and erroneous views;
(3) The self-nature inherent in the Vijñāna; (4) The eagerness for multiple forms and
appearances.By these four reasons, Mahāmati, the waves of the evolving Vijñānas are stirred
on the Ālayavijñāna which resembles the waters of a flood.The same [can be said of the
other sense-consciousnesses] as of the eye-consciousness.This consciousness arises at once
or by degrees in every sense-organ including its atoms and pores of the skin; the sense-field
is apprehended like a mirror reflecting objects, like the ocean swept over by a wind.Mahāmati,
similarly the waves of the mind-ocean are stirred uninterruptedly by the wind of
objectivity; cause, deed, and appearance condition one another inseparably; the functioning
Vijñānas and the original Vijñāna are thus inextricably bound-up together; and because
the self-nature of form, etc., is not comprehended, Mahāmati, the system of the five consciousnesses
(Vijñānas) comes to function.Along with this system of the five Vijñānas, there
is what is known as Manovijñāna [i.e., the thinking function of consciousness], whereby the
objective world is distinguished and individual appearances are distinctly determined,
and in this the physical body has its genesis.But the Manovijñāna and other Vijñānas have
no thought that they are mutually conditioned and that they grow out of their attachment to
the discrimination which is applied to the projections of Mind itself.

Thus the Vijñānas go on functioning mutually related in a most intimate manner and discriminating
a world of representations.(45) As the Vijñānas thus go on functioning [without being
conscious of their own doings], so the Yogins while entering upon a state of tranquillisation
(Samāpatti) are not aware of the workings of the subtle habit-energy [or memory] within
themselves;for they think that they would enter upon a state of tranquillisation by extinguishing
the Vijñānas.But [in fact] they are in this state without extinguishing the Vijñānas
which still subsist because the seeds of habit-energy have not been extinguished; and
[what they imagine to be] an extinction is really the non-functioning of the external world
to which they are no more attached.So it is, Mahāmati, with the subtle working of the
Ālayavijñāna, which, except for the Tathāgata and those Bodhisattvas who are established
on the stages, is not easy to comprehend; [especially] by those who practise the discipline
belonging to the Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, even with their powers of
Samādhi and transcendental knowledge, it is difficult to distinguish.Only those who, understanding
fully all the aspects of the different stages of Bodhisattvahood by the aid of their
transcendental knowledge, acquiring a definite cognition as regards the meaning of the
separate propositions, planting roots of goodness in the Buddha-lands that know no limits,
and keeping themselves away from the discriminations and false reasonings that arise from
recognising an external world which is of Mind itself, would retire into a secluded abode
in the forest and devote themselves to the practice of the spiritual discipline, either
high, or low, or middling, only those are capable of obtaining an insight into the flowing
of Mind itself in a world of discrimination, of being baptised by the Buddhas living in the
lands without limits, and of realising the self-control, powers, psychic faculties, and
Samādhis.Surrounded by good friends and the Buddhas, Mahāmati, they are capable of knowing
the Citta, Manas, Manovijñāna, which are the discriminating agents of an external world
whose self-nature is of Mind itself; they are capable of crossing the ocean of birth and death
which arises by reason of deed, desire, and ignorance.For this reason, Mahāmati, the
Yogins ought to exercise themselves in the discipline which has been given them by their good
friends and the Buddhas.

(46) At that time the Blessed One recited the following verses:
