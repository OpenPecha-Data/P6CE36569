VI Again, Mahāmati, there are seven kinds of first principle [or highest reality, Paramārtha]:
the world of thought (citta-gocara), the world of knowledge (jñāna-), the world of super-knowledge
(prajñā-), the world of dualistic views (dṛṣṭi-), the world beyond dualistic views,
the world beyond the Bodhisattva-stages, and a world where the Tathāgata attains his
self-realisation.1

(40) Mahāmati, this is the self-nature, the first principle, the essence, which constitutes
the being of the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones of the past, present, and future,
whereby, perfecting things of this world and of a world beyond this, they, by means of
a noble eye of transcendental wisdom, enter into various phases of existence, individual
and general, and establish them.And what is thus established by them is not to be confused
with the erroneous teachings generally held by the philosophers.Mahāmati, what are these
erroneous teachings accepted generally by the philosophers?[Their error lies in this] that
they do not recognise an objective world to be of Mind itself which is erroneously discriminated;and,
not understanding the nature of the Vijñānas which are also no more than manifestations
of Mind, like simple-minded ones that they are, they cherish the dualism of being
and non-being where there is but [one] self-nature and [one] first principle.Again, Mahāmati,
my teaching consists in the cessation of sufferings arising from the discrimination
of the triple world; in the cessation of ignorance, desire, deed, and causality; and in the
recognition that an objective world, like a vision, is the manifestation of Mind itself.
