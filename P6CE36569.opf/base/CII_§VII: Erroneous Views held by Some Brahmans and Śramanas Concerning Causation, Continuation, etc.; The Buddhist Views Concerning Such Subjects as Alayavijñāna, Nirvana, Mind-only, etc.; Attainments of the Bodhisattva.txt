VII Mahāmati, there are some Brahmans and Sramanas who assume something out of nothing, saying
that there exists a substance which is bound up in causation and abides in time, and that
the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas have their genesis and continuation in causation and,
after thus existing, pass away.They are those, Mahāmati, who hold a destructive and nihilistic
view concerning such subjects as continuation, activity, rising, breaking-up, existence,
Nirvāṇa, the path, karma, fruition, and truth.(41) Why? Because they have not attained
an intuitive understanding [of the Truth], because they have no fundamental insight of
things.Mahāmati, it is like a jar broken in pieces which is unable to function as a jar; again,
it is like a burnt seed which is incapable of sprouting.Even so, Mahāmati, their Skandhas,
Dhātus, and Āyatanas which they regard as subject to changes are really incapable of
uninterrupted transformation because their views do not originate from the perception of
an objective world as a manifestation of Mind itself which is erroneously discriminated.

If again, Mahāmati, something comes out of nothing and there is the rise of the Vijñānas by
reason of a combination of the three effect-producing causes, we can say the same of a non-existing
thing, that a tortoise would grow hair and sands produce oil.[As this is impossible]
this proposition does not avail, it ends in affirming nothing.And, Mahāmati, it follows
that deed, work, and cause [of which they speak] will be of no use, and so also with their
reference to being and non-being.Mahāmati, when they argue that there is a combination
of the three effect-producing causes, they do this by the principle of cause and effect [which
is to say, by the principle that something comes out of something and not of nothing];
and thus there are [such things as] past, present, and future, and being and non-being.As
long as they remain on their philosophic ground, their demonstration will be by means of
their logic and text-books, for the memory of erroneous intellection will ever cling to
them.1Thus, Mahāmati, simple-minded ones, poisoned by an erroneous view, declare the incorrect
way of thinking taught by the ignorant to be the one presented by the All-Knowing One.

Again, Mahāmati, there are some Brahmans and Sramanas who (42) recognising that the external
world which is of Mind itself is seen as such owing to the discrimination and false intellection
practised since beginningless time, know that the world has no self-nature and has
never been born, it is like a cloud, a ring produced by a firebrand, the castle of the Gandharvas,
a vision, a mirage, the moon as reflected in the ocean, and a dream; that Mind in
itself has nothing to do with discrimination and causation, discourses of imagination, and
terms of qualification (lakshya-lakṣana); that body, property, and abode are objectifications
of the Ālayavijñāna,2 which is in itself above [the dualism of] subject and object;
that the state of imagelessness which is in compliance with the awakening of Mind itself,3
is not affected by such changes as arising, abiding, and destruction.The Bodhisattvas-Mahāsattvas,
Mahāmati, will before long attain to the understanding that Nirvāṇa and Samsara
are one.Their conduct, Mahāmati, will be in accordance with the effortless exhibition of
a great loving heart that ingeniously contrives means [of salvation], knowing that all beings
have the nature of being like a vision or a reflection, and that [there is one thing which
is] not bound by causation, being beyond the distinction of subject and object; [and
further] seeing that there is nothing outside Mind, and in accordance with a position of unconditionality,
they will by degrees pass through the various stages of Bodhisattvahood and
will experience the various states of Samādhi, and will by virtue of their faith understand
that the triple world is of Mind itself, and thus understanding will attain the Samādhi
Māyopama.The Bodhisattvas entering into the state of imagelessness where they see into
the truth of Mind-only, arriving at the abode of the Paramitas, and keeping themselves away
from the thought of genesis, deed, and discipline, they will attain the Samādhi Vajravimbopama
which is in compliance with the Tathāgatakaya and with the transformations of suchness.After
achieving a revulsion in the abode [of the Vijñānas], Mahāmati, they will gradually
realise the Tathāgatakaya, which is endowed with the powers, the psychic faculties, self-control,
love, compassion, and means; which can enter into all the Buddha-lands and into
the sanctuaries of the philosophers; and which is beyond the realm of (43) Citta-mano-Manovijñāna.Therefore,
Mahāmati, these Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who wish, by following the Tathāgatakaya,
to realise it, should exercise themselves, in compliance with the truth of Mind-only,
to desist from discriminating and reasoning erroneously on such notions as Skandhas,
Dhātus, Āyatanas, thought, causation, deed, discipline, and rising, abiding, and destruction.
