VIII Perceiving that the triple existence is by reason of the habit-energy of erroneous discrimination
and false reasoning that has been going on since beginningless time, and also thinking
of the state of Buddhahood which is imageless and unborn, [the Bodhisattva] will become
thoroughly conversant with the noble truth of self-realisation, will become a perfect
master of his own mind, will conduct himself without effort, will be like a gem reflecting
a variety of colours, will be able to assume the body of transformation, will be able to
enter into the subtle minds of all beings, and, because of his firm belief in the truth
of Mind-only, will, by gradually ascending the stages, become established in Buddhahood.Therefore,
Mahāmati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva be well disciplined in self-realisation.
