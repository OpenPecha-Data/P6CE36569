X Further, Mahāmati, if the Bodhisattva should wish to understand fully that an external world
to be subsumed under categories of discrimination, such as the grasping (subject) and the
grasped (object), is of Mind itself, let him be kept away from such hindrances as turmoil,
social intercourse, and sleep;let him be kept away from the treatises and writings of
the philosophers, from things belonging to the vehicles of Śrāvakahood and Pratyekabuddhahood;let
the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva be thoroughly acquainted with objects of discrimination
which are to be seen as of Mind itself.
