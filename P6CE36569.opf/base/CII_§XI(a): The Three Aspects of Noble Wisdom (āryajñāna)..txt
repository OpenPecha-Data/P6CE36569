XI(a) Further, Mahāmati, when the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva establishes himself in the abode where
he has gained a thorough understanding of Mind by means of his transcendental knowledge,
he should later discipline himself in the cultivation of noble wisdom in its triple aspect.What
are the three aspects of noble wisdom, Mahāmati, in which he has to discipline himself
later? They are: (1) imagelessness; (2) the power added by all the Buddhas by reason
of their original vows; and (3) the self-realisation attained by noble wisdom.Having mastered
them, (50) the Yogin should abandon his knowledge of Mind gained by means of transcendental
wisdom, which still resembles a lame donkey; and entering upon the eighth stage of
Bodhisattvahood, he should further discipline himself in these three aspects of noble wisdom.

Then again, Mahāmati, the aspect of imagelessness comes forth when all things belonging to the
Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas and philosophers are thoroughly mastered.Again, Mahāmati,
as to the power added, it comes from the original vows made by all the Buddhas.Again, Mahāmati,
as to the self-realisation aspect of noble wisdom, it rises when a Bodhisattva, detaching
himself from viewing all things in their phenomenality, realises the Samādhi-body whereby
he surveys the world as like unto a vision, and further goes on to the attainment of
the Buddha-stage.Mahāmati, this is the triplicity of the noble life. Furnished with this
triplicity, noble ones will attain the state of self-realisation which is the outcome of noble
wisdom.For this reason, Mahāmati, you should cultivate noble wisdom in its triple aspect.
