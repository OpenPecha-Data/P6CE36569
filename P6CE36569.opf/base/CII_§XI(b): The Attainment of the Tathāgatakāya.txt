XI(b) At that moment, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva knowing what was going on in the minds
of the Bodhisattvas who were gathered there, and empowered by the power added to him
by all the Buddhas, asked the Blessed One concerning the doctrine known as examining into
the reality of noble wisdom.Tell me, Blessed One, the doctrine of examining into the reality
of noble wisdom, depending on which the one hundred and eight statements are to be distinguished—the
doctrine depending on which the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones will
analyse and disclose the nature and course of false imagination for the sake of (51) the
Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who have fallen into the way of looking at things from their aspects
of generality and individuality.Thus the Bodhisattvas will be instructed in the analysis
and thorough examination of false imagination, and thereby they will have the passage
purified which leads to the egolessness of things and persons, and get an illumination on
the stages of Bodhisattvahood; and, further, going beyond the bliss of the tranquillisations1
belonging to all the Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, will attain the Dharmakaya
of the Tathāgata, which belongs to the realm and course of Tathāgatahood transcending
thought and in which there is no rising of the five Dharmas. That is to say, they will
attain the Tathāgata-body which is the Dharma intimately bound up with the understanding
born of transcendental knowledge, and which, entering into the realm of Māyā, reaches all
the Buddha-lands, the heavenly mansions of Tuṣita, and the abode of the Akaniṣṭha.
