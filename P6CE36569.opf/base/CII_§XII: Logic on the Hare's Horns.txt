XII Said the Blessed One: Mahāmati, there are some philosophers who are addicted to negativism,
according to whose philosophical view the non-existence of the hare's horns is ascertained
by means of the discriminating intellect which affirms that the self-nature of things
ceases to exist with the destruction of their causes; and they say that all things are non-existent
just like the hare's horns.Again, Mahāmati, there are others who, seeing distinctions
existing in things as regards the elements, qualities, atoms, substances, formations,
and positions, and, attached to the notion that the hare's horns are non-existent, assert
that the bull has horns.There are, Mahāmati, those who have fallen into the dualistic way
of thinking, being unable to comprehend the truth of Mind-only; they desire to discriminate
a world which is of Mind itself.Mahāmati, body, property, and abode have their existence
only when measured in discrimination. (52) The hare's horns neither are nor are not; no
discrimination is to be made about them. So it is, Mahāmati, with all things, of which neither
being nor non-being can be predicated; have no discrimination about them!

Again, Mahāmati, those who have gone beyond being and non-being, no more cherish the thought
that the hare has no horns; for they never think that the hare has no horns because of mutual
reference,nor do they think that the bull has horns because no ultimate substance is
to be obtained however minutely the analysis of the horns may go on even to the subtlest particle
known as atom: [that is,] the state in which noble wisdom is realised is beyond being
and non-being.

At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this to the Blessed One: Is it not this
way, Blessed One, that, seeing how discrimination takes place, we proceed to refer this
to the non-rising of discrimination and infer that the horns exist not?The Blessed One said:
No, indeed, Mahāmati, the non-existence of the horns has no reference to the non-rising
of discrimination.Why is it not so? Because there is discrimination owing to the idea of
the horns.Indeed, depending upon the idea of the horns, Mahāmati, discrimination takes place.
And because of this dependence of discrimination upon the idea of the horns, Mahāmati,
and because of this relationship of dependence and apart from the anyananya1 relationship,
one talks of the non-existence of the hare's horns, surely not because of the reference
[to the horns of the bull].If again, Mahāmati, discrimination is different (anya) from the
hare's horns, (53) it will not take place by reason of the horns [and therefore the one is
not different from the other];but if it is not different (ananya), there is a discrimination
taking place by reason of the horns [and therefore the one is different from the other].However
minutely the atoms are analysed, no horn [-substance] is obtainable; the notion
of the horns itself is not available when thus reasoned.As neither of them [that is, the
bull's nor the hare's] are existent, in reference to what should we talk of non-existence?Therefore,
Mahāmati, the reasoning by reference as regards the non-existence of the hare's
horns is of no avail. The non-existence of the hare's horns is asserted in reference to their
existence [on the bull; but really a horn itself has no existence from the beginning];
have therefore no discrimination about it! Mahāmati, the dualism of being and non-being
as held by the philosophers does not obtain as we see in the reasoning of horns.Again, Mahāmati,
there are other philosophers affected with erroneous views, who are attached to such
notions as form, cause, and figure; not fully understanding the nature of space and seeing
that space is disjoined from form, they proceed to discriminate about their separate existences.

But, Mahāmati, space is form, and, Mahāmati, as space penetrates into form, form is space.To
establish the relation of supporting and supported, Mahāmati, there obtains the separation
of the two, space and form.Mahāmati, when the elements begin to evolve [a world] they are
distinguishable one from another; they do not abide in space, and space is not non-existent
in them.It is the same with the hare's horns, Mahāmati, whose non-existence is asserted
in reference to the bull's horns.But, Mahāmati, when the bull's horns are analysed to their
minutest atoms, which in turn are further analysed, there is after all nothing to be known
as atoms.The non-existence of what, is to be affirmed in reference to what? As to the
other things, too, this reasoning from reference (54) does not hold true.At that time, again,
the Blessed One said this to Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva; Mahāmati, you should
discard the views and discriminations that are concerned with the horns of a hare and a
bull, with space and form.

And also, Mahāmati, let you and other Bodhisattvas reflect on the nature of discrimination which
they have of the Mind itself, and let them go into all the Bodhisattva-lands where they
should disclose the way of disciplining themselves in the manifestations of Mind itself.XIII
Then at that time the Blessed One recited these verses:125 The world [as we see it]
exists not, pluralities of things rise from the Mind being seen [externally]; body, property,
and abode are manifested to us as of the Ālayavijñāna.
