Replied the Blessed One: The outflow that takes place from recognising an external world which
is of Mind itself is gradually purified and not instantaneously.Mahāmati, it is like the
amra fruit which ripens gradually and not instantaneously; in the same way, Mahāmati, the
purification of beings1 is gradual and not instantaneous.Mahāmati, it is like the potter
making pots, which is done gradually and not instantaneously; in the same way, Mahāmati,
the purification of beings by the Tathāgata is gradual and not instantaneous.Mahāmati, it
is like grass, shrubs, herbs, and trees, that grow up gradually from the earth and not instantaneously;
in the same way, Mahāmati, the purification by the Tathāgata of beings is gradual
and not instantaneous;Mahāmati, it is like the mastery of comedy, dancing, singing,
music, lute-playing, writing, and [other] arts, which is gained gradually and not instantaneously;
in the same way, Mahāmati, the purification by the Tathāgata of all beings is gradual
and not instantaneous.Mahāmati, it is like a mirror indiscriminately and instantaneously
reflecting in it forms and images; (56) in the same way, Mahāmati, the purification by
the Tathāgata of all beings is instantaneous, who makes them free from discrimination and
leads them to the state of imagelessness.Mahāmati, it is like the sun or the moon revealing
all forms instantaneously by illuminating them with its light; in the same way, Mahāmati,
the Tathāgata, by making all beings discard the habit-energy which issues from the erroneous
views they entertain in regard to an external world which is of the Mind, instantaneously
reveals to all beings the realm of unthinkable knowledge which belongs to Buddhahood.It
is like the Ālayavijñāna making instantaneously a world of body, property, and abode,
which is what is seen of Mind itself; in the same way, Mahāmati, the Niṣyanda-Buddha, instantaneously
maturing the mentality of beings, places them in the palatial abode of the Akaniṣṭha
mansion where they will become practisers of various spiritual exercises.Mahāmati,
it is like the Dharmatā-Buddha shining forth instantaneously with the rays that issue from
the Niṣyanda-Nirmana [-Buddha]; in the same way, Mahāmati, the noble truth of self-realisation
instantaneously shines out when the false [dualistic] views of existence and non-existence
are discarded.XV And yet again, Mahāmati, what the Dharmatā-Niṣyanda-Buddha [that is,
the Buddha that flows out of the absolute Dharma] teaches is that all things are comprehensible
under the aspects of individuality and generality, for they are bound up with causes
and conditions of habit-energy which is accumulated by not recognising an external world
as of Mind itself; that by reason of clinging to these false imaginations there is multitudinousness
of unrealities, which resemble the various scenes and persons created magically
and imagined as really in existence.
