Why? Because they have no reality, being manifestations of Mind itself, and, Mahāmati, as they
are not born of being and non-being, they are unborn.Mahāmati, all things are like the
horns of the hare, horse, donkey, or camel,but the ignorant and simple-minded who are given
up to their false and erroneous imaginations, discriminate things where they are not; therefore,
all things are unborn.That all things are in their self-nature unborn, Mahāmati,
belongs to the realm of self-realisation attained by noble wisdom, and does not belong essentially
to the realm of dualistic discrimination cherished by the ignorant and simple-minded.The
self-nature and the characteristic marks of body, property, and abode evolve when
the Ālayavijñāna is conceived by the ignorant as grasping and grasped; and then they fall
into a dualistic view of existence where they recognise its rise, abiding, and disappearance,
cherishing the idea that all things are born and subject to discrimination as to being
and non-being.(63) Therefore, Mahāmati, you should discipline yourself therein [i.e. in self-realisation].XX
Again further, Mahāmati, there are five groups of people, each of whom
attains its own [spiritual] insight.
