Further again, Mahāmati, false imaginations arise from clinging to the notion of relativity.To
illustrate: when the magician depending upon grass, (57) wood, shrubs, and creepers, exercises
his art, all beings and forms take shape, magically-created persons are produced,
which appear endowed with individuality and material body, and they are variously and fancifully
discriminated.While they are thus manifesting themselves, Mahāmati, there is no substantiality
in them.Likewise, Mahāmati, based on the notion of relativity the false imagination
recognises a variety of appearances which are distinguished by a discriminating mind.And
as their individual appearances are imagined and adhered to, there is habit-energy, and,
Mahāmati, so long as the fancying goes on we have here all that is needed to constitute
the self-nature of the false imagination.Mahāmati, this is the discourse of the Niṣyanda
Buddha.Again, Mahāmati, it is the doing of the Dharmatā-Buddha to establish the exalted state
of self-realisation which transcends the phenomena of the [empirical] mind.Again, Mahāmati,
what the Nirmita-Nirmana-Buddha [or Buddha of transformation] establishes concerns
such matters as charity, morality, meditation, tranquillisation, various forms of transcendental
knowledge and of understanding, the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas, emancipation, the
Vijñānas, and the ways in which they function, the forms which they take, their distinctions
and their performances.The Buddha discloses against the philosophical views that which
surpasses forms.Again Mahāmati, the Dharmatā-Buddha is unconditioned, free from conditions,
has nothing to do with all doings, senses, and measurements, and does not belong to the
world of the ignorant, Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, who are always clinging
to the notion of an ego.For this reason, Mahāmati, you should discipline yourself in
the excellent and exalted way leading to self-realisation;(58) you should keep yourself away
from the views that recognise the reality of an external world apart from the Mind itself.XVI
Further again, Mahāmati, in the life of the Śrāvaka-vehicle, there are two aspects
to be distinguished, namely, the excellent and exalted state of self-realisation, and the
attachment to the notion of self-nature arising from discrimination.
