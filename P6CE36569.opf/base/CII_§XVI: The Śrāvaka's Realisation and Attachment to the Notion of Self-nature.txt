What is the excellent, exalted state of self-realisation belonging to the Śrāvakas? This is
a state of mental concentration which is attained when one realises states of emptiness, egolessness,
suffering, and impermanence, and the truth that is free from passions and is ever
serene; when one annihilates notions belonging to the externality of things, such as the
Skandhas, Dhātus, Āyatanas, individuality and generality; and when one has an insight into
reality as it is.Entering upon this state of mental concentration the Śrāvakas will attain
the blissful abode of exalted self-realisation in which there is the emancipation belonging
to a Dhyāna, the path and fruit of a Samādhi, and the deliverance of a Samāpatti, but
in which there is as yet no discarding of habit-energy and no escape from the imperceivable
transformation of death.This, Mahāmati, is the Śrāvaka's exalted state of self-realisation.Having
attained this exalted and blissful condition of self-realisation as realised
by the Śrāvakas, Mahāmati, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva may not enjoy by himself the bliss of
cessation, the bliss of Samāpatti, but should think compassionately of other beings and
keep ever fresh his original vows.Mahāmati, in whatever exalted and blissful state of self-realisation
the Bodhisattva may find himself, he should never exert himself in the exalted
and blissful state of self-realisation as attained by the Śrāvakas.(59) Mahāmati, what is
meant by the attachment to the notion of self-nature arising from discrimination?This attachment
takes place when a man, seeing that the elements and the qualities such as blue,
yellow, warmth, humidity, motility, and rigidity, have never been created by a creator, yet
clings to the notions of individuality and generality in accordance with the measures laid
down in books of logic.Mahāmati, the Bodhisattva, knowing what this is, must abandon it.Conforming
himself to the egolessness of things and holding back the wrong views regarding
the egolessness of a person, the Bodhisattva should keep himself on the continuously-ascending
journey along the stages.This is the Śrāvaka's attachment to the notion of self-nature
arising from the discrimination of existence.XVII At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva
said this to the Blessed One:
