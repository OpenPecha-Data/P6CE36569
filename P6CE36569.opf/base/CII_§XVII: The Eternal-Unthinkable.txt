According to the Blessed One's teaching, the eternal-unthinkable is the exalted condition of
self-realisation and also of highest reality.Now, do not the philosophers also talk about
the creative agent being the eternal-unthinkable?The Blessed One replied: No, Mahāmati, the
eternal-unthinkable considered by the philosophers to be characteristic of their creator
is untenable.Why? Because, Mahāmati, the eternal-unthinkable as held by the philosophers
is not in conformity with the idea of a cause itself.When, Mahāmati, this eternal-unthinkable
is not in conformity with the idea of a cause itself how can this be proved tenable?(60)
Again, Mahāmati, if what is claimed to be the eternal-unthinkable is in conformity with
the idea of a cause [which is eternal] in itself, it can be eternal; but since the idea
of a creator is based upon that of a [further] cause, it cannot be the eternal-unthinkable.But,
Mahāmati, my highest reality is the eternal-unthinkable since it conforms to the idea
of a cause and is beyond existence and non-existence.Because it is the exalted state of
self-realisation it has its own character; because it is the cause of the highest reality
it has its causation; because it has nothing to do with existence and non-existence it is
no doer; because it is to be classed under the same head as space, Nirvāṇa, and cessation
it is eternal.Therefore, Mahāmati, it is not the same as the eternal-unthinkable of the philosophers;the
eternal-unthinkable of the Tathāgatas is thatness realised by noble wisdom
within themselves.For this reason, Mahāmati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva discipline himself
in order to attain by means of noble wisdom the truth of self-realisation which is the
eternal-unthinkable.Again, further, Mahāmati, the eternal-unthinkable of the philosophers
is not characterised with eternality because it has a cause which is not eternal;

what they regard as eternal is not eternal as it is not characterised with the power that can
create itself.If again, Mahāmati, the philosophers prove the eternality of their eternal-unthinkable
in contradistinction to the becoming and therefore the non-eternality of things
created, Mahāmati, by the same reasoning (61) I can prove that their eternality has no
reason to be known as such just because things created are non-eternal owing to their becoming.If
again, Mahāmati, the eternal-unthinkable of the philosophers is in conformity with
the idea of a cause, what they regard as characteristic of a cause is a non-entity like the
horns of a hare; and, Mahāmati, their eternal-unthinkable is no more than a verbal discrimination,
in which, Mahāmati, the philosophers' fault consists.

Why? Because, Mahāmati, mere verbal discriminations are, indeed, the hare's horns, on account
of their having no characteristic of a self-cause.Mahāmati, moreover, my eternal-unthinkable
is really eternal because it finds its cause in the exalted state of self-realisation,
and because it has nothing to do with a creator, with being and non-being.Its eternality
is not derived from the reasoning which is based upon the external notion of being and non-being,
of eternity and non-eternity.If the eternal-unthinkable is eternal in consideration
of the non-existence and eternality of external things, we can say of this kind of the
eternal-unthinkable that the philosophers do not know what is meant by characteristically
self-caused.As they are outside the state of self-realisation attainable by noble wisdom,
Mahāmati, their discourse is not to the point.XVIII Further, Mahāmati, those who, afraid of
sufferings arising from the discrimination of birth-and-death, seek for Nirvāṇa, do not
know that birth-and-death and Nirvāṇa are not to be separated the one from the other; and,
seeing that all things subject to discrimination have no reality, imagine that Nirvāṇa consists
in the future annihilation of the senses and their fields.
