(62) They are not aware, Mahāmati, of the fact that Nirvāṇa is the Ālayavijñāna where a revulsion
takes place by self-realisation.Therefore, Mahāmati, those who are stupid talk of the
trinity of vehicles and not of the state of Mind-only where there are no images.Therefore,
Mahāmati, those who do not understand the teachings of the Tathāgatas of the past, present,
and future, concerning the external world, which is of Mind itself, cling to the notion
that there is a world outside what is seen of the Mindand, Mahāmati, go on rolling themselves
along the wheel of birth-and-death.XIX Further, Mahāmati, according to the teaching
of the Tathāgatas of the past, present, and future, all things are unborn.
