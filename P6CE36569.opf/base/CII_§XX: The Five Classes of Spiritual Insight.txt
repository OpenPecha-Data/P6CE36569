What are the five? They are: (1) the group of people whose insight belongs to the Śrāvaka-vehicle;
(2) the group of people whose insight belongs to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle; (3) the
group of people whose insight belongs to the Tathāgata-vehicle; (4) the group of indefinite
character; and (5) the group of people to whom no insight is possible.Mahāmati, how does
one know the group of people whose insight belongs to the Śrāvaka vehicle? There are people
the hair of whose body will stand on end when they know and realise the nature of the
Skandhas, Dhātus, Āyatanas, and [what is meant by] generality and individuality;their intellect
will leap with joy on knowing and practising what belongs to appearance and not on
practising what they know of the uninterrupted chain of causation, —such ones, Mahāmati, are
said to be of the group whose insight belongs to the Śrāvaka vehicle.Having had an insight
into their own vehicle, they abide at the fifth or the sixth stage where they do away
with the rising of the passions, but not with the habit-energy; they have not yet passed beyond
the inconceivable transformation-death, and their lion-roar is, “My life is destroyed,
my morality is established, etc."; they will then discipline themselves in the egolessness
of persons and finally gain the knowledge of Nirvāṇa.Again, Mahāmati, there are others
who, believing in such things as ego, being, vital principle, nourisher, supreme spirit,
or personal soul, will seek Nirvāṇa in them.

Again, Mahāmati, there are still others who, seeing that all things exist by depending upon
causes, will recognise in this the way to Nirvāṇa.(64) But, Mahāmati, as they have no insight
into the egolessness of things, there is no emancipation for them.This, Mahāmati, is where
those of the Śrāvaka-vehicle and the philosophers make the mistake in their insight by
regarding non-deliverance as deliverance.Therefore, Mahāmati, you ought to discipline yourself
in order to escape this wrong view.Now, Mahāmati, they belong to the group of the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle
who will shed tears and feel the hair of their body stand on end when
the Pratyekabuddha's insight is shown to them.

When the teaching to keep themselves away from social relations and entanglements, not to become
attached to the external world and its manifold form, to perform miraculous powers by
which they can divide their own body and appear double or perform the transformations, is
disclosed to them, they are thereby entreated.Recognising that they are of the group whose
insight belong to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, their discourses will be in conformity with
the insight of the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle.This, Mahāmati, is the characteristic feature
of the group of people whose insight belongs to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle.Now, Mahāmati,
three aspects are distinguishable in the insight belonging to the group of the Tathāgata-vehicle.

They are: (1) an insight whereby one sees into the self-nature of things, which is no self-nature;
(2) an exalted insight which is the attainment of self-realisation; and (3) an insight
into the immensity of the external Buddha-lands.When, Mahāmati, these three aspects are
disclosed one after another and also when the inconceivable realm of the Ālayavijñāna is
disclosed, where body, property, and abode are seen to be the manifestation of Mind itself,
a man will not be frightened, nor terrified, nor show any sign of fear; then such a one
is to be known as of the group of people whose insight belongs to the Tathāgata-vehicle.This
is, (65) Mahāmati, the characteristic feature of the insight of those who belong to the
Tathāgata-vehicle.Again, Mahāmati, when these three forms of insight are disclosed to a
man, he may thereby be pursuaded to discipline himself in them.

This, Mahāmati, is the stage of preparation for the establishment of his own group.In order
that he may go up to the stage of imagelessness, there is this establishment.But the Śrāvaka
who will purify his own habit-energy of passions by attaining an inner perception into
the Ālaya and by seeing into the egolessness of things, will settle himself in the bliss of
the Samādhi and finally will attain the body of Tathāgatahood.1XXI Then the Blessed One
recited these verses:130 The fruit of the Stream-entered, and that of the Once-to-come; the
fruit of the Not-to-come and Arhatship— all these are due to mental perturbation.
