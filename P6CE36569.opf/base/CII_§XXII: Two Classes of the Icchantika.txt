What is meant by abandoning all the stock of merit? It refers to [those Buddhists] who have
abandoned the Bodhisattva collection [of the canonical texts], making the false accusation
that they are not in conformity with the sūtras, the codes of morality, and the emancipation.
By this they have forsaken all the stock of merit and will not enter into Nirvāṇa.Secondly
again, Mahāmati, there are Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who, on account of their original
vows made for all beings, saying, “So long as they do not attain Nirvāṇa, I will not attain
it myself," keep themselves away from Nirvāṇa.This, Mahāmati, is the reason of their not
entering into Nirvāṇa, and because of this they go on the way of the Icchantika.Again, Mahāmati
said; Who, Blessed One, would never enter Nirvāṇa?

The Blessed One replied: Knowing that all things are in Nirvāṇa itself from the very beginning,
the Bodhisattva-Icchantika would never enter Nirvāṇa.But those Icchantikas who have forsaken
all the stock of merit [finally] do.Those Icchantikas, Mahāmati, who have forsaken
all the stock of merit might some day be influenced by the power of the Tathāgatas and be
induced at any moment to foster the stock of merit.Why? Because, Mahāmati, no beings are left
aside by the Tathāgatas.For this reason, Mahāmati, it is the Bodhisattva-Icchantika (67)
who never enters into Nirvāṇa.XXIII Further, Mahāmati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva be
well acquainted with the three kinds of Svabhāva (self-nature).
