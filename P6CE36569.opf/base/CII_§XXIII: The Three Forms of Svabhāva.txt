[What are the three? They are (1) false discrimination, (2) knowledge of relativity, and (3)
perfect knowledge.] Now, Mahāmati, false discrimination rises from form (nimitta).How, Mahāmati,
does it rise from form? In [the consideration of] the relativity aspect of Svabhāva,
realities appear in various ways, as having forms, signs, and shapes;when, Mahāmati, these
objects, forms, and signs are adhered to [as real], this adherence takes place in two
ways.The Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Fully-Enlightened Ones thus declare false discrimination
to consist in attachment to names and attachment to objects.By the attachment to objects is
meant, Mahāmati, to get attached to inner and external things [as realities].By the attachment
to names is meant to recognise in these inner and external things the characteristic
marks of individuality and generality and to regard them as definitely belonging to the
objects.These two modes of attachment, Mahāmati, constitute false discrimination.The knowledge
of the relativity-aspect (paratantra) rises from the separation of subject (asraya) and
object (alambana).Now, Mahāmati, what is perfect knowledge? It is realised when one casts
aside the discriminating notions of form, name, reality, and character; it is the inner
realisation by noble wisdom.This (68) perfect knowledge, Mahāmati, is the essence of the
Tathāgata-garbha.Then the Blessed One recited this verse:134 Form, Name, and Discrimination
[correspond to] the two forms of Svabhāva, and Right Knowledge and Suchness [correspond
to] the Perfect Knowledge aspect.
