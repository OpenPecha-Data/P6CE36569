Mahāmati, what is this twofold egolessness? [It is the egolessness of persons and the egolessness
of things.What is meant by egolessness of persons? It means that] in the collection
of the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas there is no ego-substance, nor anything belonging to
it; the Vijñāna is originated by ignorance, deed, and desire, and keeps up its function by
grasping objects by means of the sense-organs, such as the eye, etc., and by clinging to
them as real; while a world of objects and bodies is manifested owing to the discrimination
that takes place in the world which is of Mind itself, that is, in the Ālayavijñāna.By
reason of the habit-energy stored up by false imagination since beginningless time, this world
(vishaya) is subject to change and destruction from moment to moment; it is like a river,
a seed, a lamp, wind, a cloud; [while the Vijñāna itself is] like a monkey who is always
restless, like a fly who is ever in search of unclean things and defiled places, like
a fire (69) which is never satisfied. Again, it is like a water-drawing wheel or a machine,
it [i.e., the Vijñāna] goes on rolling the wheel of transmigration, carrying varieties of
bodies and forms, resuscitating the dead like the demon Vetala, causing the wooden figures
to move about as a magician moves them.Mahāmati, a thorough understanding concerning these
phenomena is called comprehending the egolessness of persons.Now, Mahāmati, what is meant
by the egolessness of things? It is to realise that the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas
are characterised with the nature of false discrimination.

Mahāmati, since the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas are destitute of an ego-substance, being
no more than an aggregation of the Skandhas, and subject to the conditions of mutual origination
which are causally bound up with the string of desire and deed; and since thus there
is no creating agent in them, Mahāmati, the Skandhas are even destitute of the marks of
individuality and generality; and the ignorant, owing to their erroneous discrimination, imagine
here the multiplicity of phenomena; the wise, however, do not.Recognising, Mahāmati,
that all things are devoid of the Citta, Manas, Manovijñāna, the five Dharmas, and the [three]
Svabhāvas, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva will well understand what is meant by the egolessness
of things.Again, Mahāmati, when the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva has a good understanding
as regards the egolessness of things, before long he will attain the first stage [of Bodhisattvahood]
when he gets a definite cognition of the imageless.When a definite acquisition
is obtained regarding the aspect of the stages [of Bodhisattvahood], the Bodhisattva will
experience joy, and, gradually and successively going up the scale, will reach the ninth
stage where his insight is perfected, and [finally the tenth stage known as] Great Dharmamegha.Establishing
himself here, (70) he will be seated in the great jewel palace known
as “Great Lotus Throne" which is in the shape of a lotus and is adorned with various sorts
of jewels and pearls; he will then acquire and complete a world of Māyā-nature; surrounded
by Bodhisattvas of the same character and anointed like the son of the Cakravarti by the
hands of the Buddhas coming from all the Buddha-lands,he will go beyond the last stage of
Bodhisattvahood, attain the noble truth of self-realisation, and become a Tathāgata endowed
with the perfect freedom of the Dharmakaya, because of his insight into the egolessness
of things.This, Mahāmati, is what is meant by the egolessness of all things,and in this you
and other Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas should well exercise yourselves.XXV At that time, Mahāmati
the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this to the Blessed One:
