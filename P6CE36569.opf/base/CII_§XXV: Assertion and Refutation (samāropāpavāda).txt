Pray teach me about making an assertion and refuting it so that I and other Bodhisattvas, getting
rid of the erroneous views that may rise from assertion and refutation, may at once
realise supreme enlightenment.Having been enlightened they would keep themselves away from
the eternalistic assertions as well as from the nihilistic refutations, and leave your enlightenment
eye unrefuted.Then the Blessed One again, understanding the request of Mahāmati
the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, recited this verse:

135 Assertions and refutations are not to be found in the Mind-only; the ignorant who understand
not that the Mind is [seen in] the form of body, property, and abode, wander about with
assertions and refutations.
