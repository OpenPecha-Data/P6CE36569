just like the imagination that evolves from the seat of the relativity knowledge, and again,
like the mysterious gem that reflects varieties of colours.Going over to all the Buddha-lands
and assemblages, the Bodhisattvas will listen to the Buddhas, discourse on the nature
of all things which are like a vision, a dream, an illusion, a reflection, and the lunar
vision in water, and which have nothing to do with birth-and-death, eternality, and extinction;
the Bodhisattvas, thus facing the Tathāgatas, will listen to their discourses on the
truth that does not belong to the Śrāvaka- and Pratyekabuddha-vehicle.They will then attain
a hundred thousand Samādhis, (73) indeed, a hundred thousand niyutas of kotis of Samādhis,
and by means of these Samādhis they will go around from one country to another;they will
do homage to the Buddhas, be born in all the celestial mansions, where they will discourse
on the Triple Treasure, manifesting Buddha-bodies; and, surrounded by Śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas,
they will, in order to free them from the alternatives of being and non-being,
instruct them to understand thoroughly what is meant by an objective world which is nothing
but Mind itself and in which there are no realities.

At that time the Blessed One recited this verse:136 When those who are born of the Buddha see
that the world is no more than Mind itself, they will obtain a body of transformation, which
has nothing to do with effect-producing works, but which is endowed with the powers,
psychic faculties, and self-control.
