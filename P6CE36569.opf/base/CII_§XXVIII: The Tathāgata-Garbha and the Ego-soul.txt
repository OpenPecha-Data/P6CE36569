XXVIII At that time, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this to the Blessed One:Now the
Blessed One makes mention of the Tathāgata-garbha in the sūtras,and verily it is described
by you as by nature bright and pure, as primarily unspotted, endowed with the thirty-two
marks of excellence,hidden in the body of every being like a gem of great value, which is
enwrapped in a dirty garment, enveloped in the garment of the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas,
and soiled with the dirt of greed, anger, folly, and false imagination, (78) while it
is described by the Blessed One to be eternal, permanent, auspicious, and unchangeable.Is
not this Tathāgata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the ego-substance taught
by the philosophers?The ego as taught in the systems of the philosophers is an eternal creator,
unqualified, omnipresent, and imperishable.

The Blessed One replied: No, Mahāmati, my Tathāgata-garbha is not the same as the ego taught
by the philosophers;for what the Tathāgatas teach is the Tathāgata-garbha in the sense, Mahāmati,
that it is emptiness, reality-limit, Nirvāṇa, being unborn, unqualified, and devoid
of will-effort; the reason why the Tathāgatas who are Arhats and Fully-Enlightened Ones,
teach the doctrine pointing to the Tathāgata-garbha is to make the ignorant cast aside their
fear when they listen to the teaching of egolessness and to have them realise the state
of non-discrimination and imagelessness.I also wish, Mahāmati, that the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas
of the present and future would not attach themselves to the idea of an ego [imagining
it to be a soul].Mahāmati, it is like a potter who manufactures various vessels out
of a mass of clay of one sort by his own manual skill and labour combined with a rod, water,
and thread, Mahāmati, that the Tathāgatas preach the egolessness of things which removes
all the traces of discrimination by various skilful means issuing from their transcendental
wisdom, that is, sometimes by the doctrine of the Tathāgata-garbha, sometimes by that
of egolessness, and, like a potter, by means of various terms, expressions, and synonyms.For
this reason, Mahāmati, the philosophers' doctrine of an ego-substance is not the same (79)
as the teaching of the Tathāgata-garbha.Thus, Mahāmati, the doctrine of the Tathāgata-garbha
is disclosed in order to awaken the philosophers from their clinging to the idea of
the ego, so that those minds that have fallen into the views imagining the non-existent ego
as real, and also into the notion that the triple emancipation is final, may rapidly be
awakened to the state of supreme enlightenment.Accordingly, Mahāmati, the Tathāgatas who
are Arhats and Fully-Enlightened Ones disclose the doctrine of the Tathāgata-garbha which
is thus not to be known as identical with the philosopher's notion of an ego-substance.Therefore,
Mahāmati, in order to abandon the misconception cherished by the philosophers, you
must strive after the teaching of egolessness and the Tathāgata-garbha.
