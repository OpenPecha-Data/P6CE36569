XXX At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva in consideration of future generations
made this request again of the Blessed One: Pray tell me, Blessed One, about the perfecting
of the discipline whereby the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas become great Yogins.The Blessed One
replied: There are four things, Mahāmati, by fulfilling which the Bodhisattvas become great
Yogins.What are the four? They are: (1) To have a clear understanding as to what is seen
of Mind itself,1 (2) to discard the notions of birth, (80) abiding, and disappearance,
(3) to look into [the truth] that no external world obtains, and (4) to seek for the attainment
of inner realisation by noble wisdom.Provided with these four things the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas
become great Yogins.

How, Mahāmati, does the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva come to have a clear understanding as to what
is seen of Mind itself?He comes to it by recognising that this triple world is nothing but
Mind itself, devoid of an ego and its belongings, with no strivings, no comings-and-goings;
that this triple world is manifested and imagined as real, under the influence of the
habit-energy accumulated since beginningless time by false reasoning and imagination, and
with the multiplicity of objects and actions in close relationship, and in conformity with
the ideas of discrimination, such as body, property, and abode.Thus, Mahāmati, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva
acquires a thoroughly clear understanding as to what is seen of Mind itself.

How again, Mahāmati, does the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva discard notions of birth, abiding, and
disappearance?By this it is meant that all things are to be regarded as forms born of a vision
or a dream and have never been created since there are no such things as self, the other,
or bothness.[The Bodhisattvas] will see that the external world exists only in conformity
with Mind-only; and seeing that there is no stirring of the Vijñānas and that the triple
world is a complicated network of causation and owes its rise to discrimination, (81)
they find that all things, inner and external, are beyond predicability, that there is nothing
to be seen as self-nature, and that [the world] is not to be viewed as born; and thereby
they will conform themselves to the insight that things are of the nature of a vision,
etc., and attain to the recognition that things are unborn.Establishing themselves on the
eighth stage of Bodhisattvahood, they will experience a revulsion [in their consciousness]
by transcending the Citta, Manas, and Manovijñāna, and the five Dharmas, and the [three]
Svabhāvas, and the twofold Egolessness, and thereby attain the mind-made body (Manomayakāya).

Thus, Mahāmati, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva will discard the notion of birth, abiding, and disappearance.2
Said Mahāmati,3 what is meant by the will-body, Blessed One?The Blessed One
replied: It means that one [in this body] can speedily move unobstructed as he wills; hence
the will-body, Mahāmati.For instance, Mahāmati, the will [or mind] travels unobstructed
over mountains, walls, rivers, trees, etc., many a hundred thousand yojanas they may be away,
when a man recollects the scenes which had previously come into his perception, while
his own mind keeps on functioning in his body without the least interruption or hindrance.In
the same fashion, Mahāmati, the will-body, in the attainment of the Samādhi called Māyā-like
and adorned with such marks as the powers, the psychic faculties, and the self-control,
will be born in the noble paths and assemblies, moving about as freely as he wishes, as
he recalls his original vows and worlds in order to bring all beings to maturity.4

Then, Mahāmati, what is meant by the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva (82) having a good insight into
the non-existence of external objects?It means, Mahāmati, that all things are like unto a
mirage, a dream, a hair-net;and seeing that all things are here essentially because of our
attachment to the habit-energy of discrimination which has been maturing since beginningless
time on account of false imagination and erroneous speculation, the Bodhisattvas will
seek after the attainment of self-realisation by their noble wisdom.Mahāmati, furnished with
these four things, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas become great Yogins.Therefore, in these, Mahāmati,
you should exercise yourself.
