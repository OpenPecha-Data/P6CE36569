XXXI At that time Mahāmati again made a request of the Blessed One:Pray tell me, Blessed One,
about the causation of all things, whereby I and other Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas can see into
the nature of causation, and by getting rid of the discrimination [which issues in the
philosophical views of] eternalism and nihilism, we may no more discriminate as to the gradual
or simultaneous rising of all things.

Replied the Blessed One: Mahāmati, there are two factors of causation by which all things come
into existence: external and inner.Mahāmati, the external factors are a lump of clay, a
stick, a wheel, thread, water, a worker, and his labour, the combination of all of which
produces a jar.As with the jar, Mahāmati, which is made of a lump of clay, or a piece of cloth
made of thread, or a matting made of fragrant grass, or the sprout growing out of a seed,
or fresh butter which is produced from sour milk by a man churning it with his own labour,
(83) so it is, Mahāmati, with all things which, governed by external causes, appear
one after another in continuous succession.

As regards the inner factors of causation, Mahāmati, they are of such kind as ignorance, desire,
and action, which make up our idea of causation.Born of these, Mahāmati, there is the
manifestation of the Skandhas, Dhātus, and Āyatanas.They are not separable [realities]1 but
discriminated [as such] by the ignorant.

Now, Mahāmati, there are six causes: (1) possibility-cause, (2) dependence-cause, (3) objectivity-cause,
(4) agency-cause, (5) manifesting-cause, and (6) indifference-cause.2The possibility-cause
means, Mahāmati, that when a cause to be becomes effective there is the rising
of things inner and outer.The dependence-cause means, Mahāmati, that when conditions to
be, become effective there is the rising of the Skandha-seeds, etc., inner and outer.Further,
the objectivity-cause means, Mahāmati, that bound by the objective world [the Vijñāna]
keeps up its continuous activity.Again, Mahāmati, the agency-cause means that like a sovereign
king a cause invested with supreme authority asserts itself.Again, the manifesting-cause
means that when the discriminating faculty rises, as the result it reveals individual
marks as a lamp does forms, etc.Lastly, the indifference-cause means that when there is
a dissolution (84) the power of combination discontinues, and there rises a state of non-discrimination.

These, Mahāmati, are the outcome of discrimination carried on by the ignorant and simple-minded,
and there is no gradual nor simultaneous rising of existence.Why? Because, Mahāmati,
if there is a simultaneous rising of existence, there would be no distinction between cause
and effect, and there would be nothing to characterise a cause as such.If a gradual rising
is admitted, there is no substance that holds together individual signs, which makes gradual
rising impossible.While a child is not yet born, Mahāmati, the term father has no significance.3The
logician argues that there is that which is born and that which gives birth
by the mutual functioning of such causal factors as cause, subsistence, continuity, acceleration,
and others; and they conclude that there is a gradual rising of existence.But, Mahāmati,
this gradual rising does not obtain except by reason of their attachment to the notion
of self-nature.When the [ideas of] body, property, and abode are cherished in what is
nothing but the manifestation of Mind itself, the external world is perceived under the
aspects of individuality and generality, which, however, are not realities; and therefore,
Mahāmati, neither a gradual nor a simultaneous rising of things is possible.It is only when
the Vijñāna evolves by reason of discrimination which discriminates the manifestation of
Mind itself [that existence is said to come into view].For this reason, Mahāmati, you must
strive to get rid of notions of gradation and simultaneity in the combination of the causal
activities.

Thus it is said:140 Nothing whatever is born or ceases to exist by reason of causation; when
causation is discriminated there is birth and cessation.

(85) 141 It is not to keep off the idea of birth and disappearance which takes place in causation;
it is to keep off the wrong imagination as to causation, which is cherished by the
ignorant.

142 The being and non-being of things subject to causation has no reality; the triple world
owes its existence to the Mind put into confusion by reason of habit-energy.

143 Not ever being in existence, what things are there that are born? [but] in causation nothing
is lost; when effect-producing objects (samskrita) are regarded as like unto a barren
woman's child or a flower in the sky, one perceives that grasping (subject) and grasped (object)
are an error and desists [from committing the same error].

144 There is nothing that is to be born, nor is there anything that has been born; even causation
is not; it is because of wordly usage that things are talked of as existing.
