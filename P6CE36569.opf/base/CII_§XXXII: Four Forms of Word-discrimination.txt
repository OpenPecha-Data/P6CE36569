XXXII At that moment again Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this to the Blessed One:Pray
tell me, Blessed One, about the teaching known as the essence of discrimination as regards
words, whereby, Blessed One, I and other Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, comprehending and
becoming well acquainted with the essence of discrimination as regards words, will be thoroughly
informed of the signification of two things, expression and expressed, and, thereby
immediately attaining supreme enlightenment, will explain the signification of these two
things, expression and expressed, for the purification of all beings.Replied the Blessed One:
Then, Mahāmati, listen well and reflect well, (86) for I will tell you about it.Well done!
said Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and listened to the Blessed One.The Blessed
One said this to him: There are, Mahāmati, four kinds of word-discrimination.They are: (1)
Words denoting individual marks, (2) dream-words, (3) words growing out of the attachment
to erroneous speculations and discriminations, and (4) words growing out of the discrimination
that knows no beginning.

Now, Mahāmati, the words denoting individual marks rise from discriminating forms and characteristic
signs as real in themselves and becoming attached to them.The dream-words, Mahāmati,
rise from the unreal surroundings which reveal themselves [before the mind] when it recollects
its previous experience.The words growing out of the attachment to erroneous speculations
and discriminations, Mahāmati, rise from recollecting deeds once previously committed.The
words growing out of the discrimination that has been functioning since beginningless
time, Mahāmati, rise from the habit-energy whose seeds have been growing out of the clinging
to erroneous speculations and false imaginations since beginningless time.I say, Mahāmati,
these are the four features of word-discrimination, which is the answer to your question.
