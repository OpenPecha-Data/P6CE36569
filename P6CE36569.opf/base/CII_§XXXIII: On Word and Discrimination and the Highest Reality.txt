XXXIII At that time again, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva requested of the Blessed One
to speak on this subject:Pray tell me again, Blessed One, about the conditions whereby the
word-discrimination manifests itself.Where, whence, how, and by whom do words indicating
discrimination take place among the people?Said the Blessed One: Mahāmati, the word-discrimination
goes on taking place by the coordination of the head, chest, nose, throat, palate,
lips, tongue, and teeth.Said Mahāmati; Again, Blessed One, (87) are words to be considered
different (anya) or not-different (ananya) from discrimination?Replied the Blessed One:
Mahāmati, they are neither different nor not-different.Why? Because words rise, Mahāmati,
with discrimination as their cause.If, Mahāmati, words are different from discrimination,
they cannot have it for cause.Then if they are not different, words cannot express the sense,
which they do.Therefore, words and discrimination are neither different nor not-different.

Then Mahāmati said: Again, Blessed One, are words themselves the highest reality? or is what
is expressed in words the highest reality?The Blessed One replied: Mahāmati, words are not
the highest reality, nor is what is expressed in words the highest reality.Why? Because
the highest reality is an exalted state of bliss, and as it cannot be entered into by mere
statements regarding it, words are not the highest reality.Mahāmati, the highest reality
is to be attained by the inner realisation of noble wisdom; it is not a state of word-discrimination;therefore,
discrimination does not express the highest reality.And then, Mahāmati,
words are subject to birth and destruction; they are unsteady, mutually conditioning,
and are produced by the law of causation.And again, Mahāmati, what is mutually conditioning
and produced by the law of causation cannot express the highest reality, because the indications
[pointing to the distinction between] self and not-self are non-existent.Mahāmati,
words are these indications and do not express [the highest reality].

(88) Further, Mahāmati, word-discrimination cannot express the highest reality, for external
objects with their multitudinous individual marks are non-existent, and only appear before
us as something revealed out of Mind itself.Therefore, Mahāmati, you must try to keep yourself
away from the various forms of word-discrimination.
