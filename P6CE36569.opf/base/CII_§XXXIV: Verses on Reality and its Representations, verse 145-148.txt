XXXIV Thus it is said:145 In all things there is no self-nature, words too are devoid of reality;
as the ignorant understand not what is meant by emptiness, yes, by emptiness, they wander
about.

146 In all things there is no self-nature, they are mere words of people; that which is discriminated
has no reality; [even] Nirvāṇa is like a dream; nothing is seen to be in transmigration,
nor does anything ever enter into Nirvāṇa.

147 As a king or a wealthy householder, giving his children various clay-made animals, pleases
them and makes them play [with the toys], but later gives them real ones;

148 So, I, making use of various forms and images of things, instruct my sons; but the limit
of reality (bhutakoti) can [only] be realised within oneself.
