XXXV At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva again (89) said this to the Blessed One:Pray
tell me, Blessed One, about the attainment of self-realisation by noble wisdom, which
does not belong to the path and the usage of the philosophers; which is devoid of [all
such predicates as] being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness,
existence and non-existence, eternity and non-eternity;which has nothing to do with the false
imagination, nor with individuality and generality; which manifests itself as the truth
of highest reality;which, going up continuously by degrees the stages of purification,
enters upon the stage of Tathāgatahood;which, because of the original vows unattended by any
striving, will perform its works in infinite worlds like a gem reflecting a variety of
colours; and which is manifested [when one perceives how] signs of individuation rise in all
things as one realises the course and realm of what is seen of Mind itself,and thereby
I and other Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas are enabled to survey things from the point of view which
is not hampered by marks of individuality and generality nor by anything of the false
imagination, and may quickly attain supreme enlightenment and enable all beings to achieve
the perfection of all their virtues.

Replied the Blessed One: Well done, well done, Mahāmati! and again, well done, indeed, Mahāmati!Because
of your compassion for the world, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness
of many people, for the welfare, benefit, happiness of many people, both of celestial
beings and humankind, Mahāmati, you present yourself before me and make this request.Therefore,
Mahāmati, listen well and truly, and reflect, for I will tell you.Assuredly, said
Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, and gave ear to the Blessed One.(90) The Blessed One
said this to him: Mahāmati, since the ignorant and the simple-minded, not knowing that the
world is what is seen of Mind itself, cling to the multitudinousness of external objects,
cling to the notions of being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness,
existence and non-existence, eternity and non-eternity, as being characterised by self-nature
which rises from discrimination based on habit-energy, they are addicted to false
imaginings.Mahāmati, it is like a mirage in which the springs are seen as if they were real.
They are imagined so by the animals who, thirsty from the heat of the season, would run
after them.Not knowing that the springs are their own mental hallucinations, the animals
do not realise that there are no such springs.In the same way, Mahāmati, the ignorant and
simple-minded with their minds impressed by various erroneous speculations and discriminations
since beginningless time; with their minds burning with the fire of greed, anger, and
folly; delighted in a world of multitudinous forms; with their thoughts saturated with
the ideas of birth, destruction, and subsistence; not understanding well what is meant by
existent and non-existent, by inner and outer;the ignorant and simple-minded fall into the
way of grasping at oneness and otherness, being and non-being.Mahāmati, it is like the city
of the Gandharvas which the unwitted take for a real city, though it is not so in fact.This
city appears in essence owing to their attachment to the memory of a city preserved in
seed from beginningless time.This city is thus neither existent nor non-existent.In the
same way, Mahāmati, clinging to the memory (vasana) of erroneous speculations and doctrines
since beginningless time, they hold fast to ideas such as oneness and otherness, being and
non-being, and their thoughts are not at all clear about what is seen of Mind-only.(91)
Mahāmati, it is like a man, who, dreaming in his sleep of a country variously filled with
women, men, elephants, horses, cars, pedestrians, villages, towns, hamlets, cows, buffalos,
mansions, woods, mountains, rivers, and lakes enters into its inner appartments and is
awakened.While awakened thus, he recollects the city and its inner apartments.What do you
think, Mahāmati? Is this person to be regarded as wise, who is recollecting the various unrealities
he has seen in his dream? Said Mahāmati: Indeed, he is not, Blessed One.The Blessed
One continued: In the same way the ignorant and simple-minded who are bitten by erroneous
views and are inclined toward the philosophers, do not recognise that things seen of the
Mind itself are like a dream, and are held fast by the notions of oneness and otherness,
of being and non-being.Mahāmati, it is like the painter's canvas on which there is no depression
nor elevation as imagined by the ignorant.In the same way, Mahāmati, there may be
in the future some people brought up in the habit-energy, mentality, and imagination based
on the philosophers' erroneous views;clinging to the ideas of oneness and otherness, of
bothness and not-bothness, they may bring themselves and others to ruin; they may declare
those people nihilists who hold the doctrine of no-birth apart from the alternatives of being
and non-being.They [argue against] cause and effect, they are followers of the wicked
views whereby they uproot meritorious causes of unstained purity.They are to be kept far away
by those whose desires are for things excellent.They are those whose thoughts are entangled
in the errors of self, other, and both, (92) in the errors of imagining being and non-being,
assertion and refutation, and hell will be their final refuge.Mahāmati, it is like
the dim-eyed ones who, seeing a hair-net, would exclaim to one another, saying: “It is wonderful!
it is wonderful! Look, O honourable sirs!"And the said hair-net has never been brought
into existence. It is in fact neither an entity nor a non-entity, because it is seen
and not seen.In the same manner, Mahāmati, those whose minds are addicted to discrimination
of the erroneous views as cherished by the philosophers, and who are also given up to
the realistic ideas of being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness,
will contradict the good Dharma, ending in the destruction of themselves and others.Mahāmati,
it is like a firebrand-wheel which is no real wheel but which is imagined to be of
such character by the ignorant, but not by the wise......
