1. “The truth-treasure whose principle is the self-nature of Mind, has no selfhood (nairātmyam),
stands above all reasoning, and is free from impurities; it points to the knowledge attained
in one's inmost self; Lord, show me here the way leading to the Truth.

2. “The Sugata is the body in whom are stored immaculate virtues; in him are manifested [bodies]
trans-forming and transformed; he enjoys the Truth realised in his inmost self; may he
visit Laṅkā. Now is the time, Muni!

3. (4) “This Laṅkā was inhabited by the Buddhas of the past, and [they were] accompanied by
their sons who were owners of many forms. Lord, show me now the highest Truth, and the Yakshas
who are endowed with many forms will listen.”

Thereupon, Rāvaṇa, the Lord of Laṅkā, further adapting the Totaka rhythm sang this in the measure
of the Gāthā.
